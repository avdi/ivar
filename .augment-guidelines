- tests are in minitest
- use modern Ruby 3.4 style and features, including pattern-matching, endless methods, etc., where appropriate.
- avoid over-engineering. Prefer basic Ruby data types to building new abstractions. (But extract abstractions when I tell you to.)
- avoid inline comments. Prefer "explaining variables", intention-revealing method names, and the "composed method" pattern where appropriate. Class, module, and method-documenting comments are fine.
- De-lint (with standardrb) before committing. Use auto-fix and manually fix the rest.
- Run all tests and fix failures before committing. 
- Never "cheat" by making implementation code test-aware. But it is fine to make interactions with the world dependency-injectable for testing purposes.
- Include a quote of my instruction that led to the commit in the commit message
- Sign your commit messages with "-- Auggie".
- Commit and push after making successful changes.
